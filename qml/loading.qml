// This QML file is used to create a simple popup
// It will show an overlay on top of the parent and a small white area
// that is the dialog itself. For demo purposes no fancy stuff in the popup

import QtQuick 2.0
// Use an item as container to group both the overlay and the dialog
// I do this because the overlay itself has an opacity set, and otherwise
// also the dialog would have been semi-transparent.
// I use an Item instead of an Rectangle. Always use an 'Item' if it does not
// display stuff itself, this is better performance wise.
